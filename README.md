 Help the project team understand the data  they have so that they can explain it to the people in Bayer who decide whether weâ€™ll fund an expensive Phase III program. Task is to look at the data and produce what summaries and visualizations you think reasonable before you go into a meeting with the project team to discuss what can be done.
